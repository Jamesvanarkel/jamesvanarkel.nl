      <p class="text-about"> On this page you can read what my vision is and how I translate that into my work. This can make you understand my work-style and my fision more precisly. The way I work is mostly a combination of feeling and tecnique I learned and ofcourse the experiance I gained in the work before. I simpley love the thing I do!</p>
      <img class="image-about" src="images/serviceme.png" />
      
      <p class="text-about"> Webdesign is one of my many passion’s. It is nice to see the time and enegry you spent in a project redirects on a smile on a customers face. That’s what keeps me learning and putting my 100 procent in my work. The learning part is very important for me. The field of work already is a field were you have to keep on learning to stay up-to-date.  </p>

      <p class="text-about"> That was my fision on the work field. But what can I do for you? I can guarantee that the time I put in a project wil resalute in quality in the end product. Also I can say that I work with a structure so this means I start out with scetches I try to find a person that would most likley be a end-user. Test the scetch and work the feedback in the product. Finaly build it (the fun part). But now you know this you would problebly want to get to know me a little better. You could do this in two ways. 1. <a href="contact.html"> come in contact with me! </a> or 2. <a href="aboutjva.html"> read about me </a>.   </p>
