      <p class="text-about"> Hi there, My name is <strong> James van Arkel </strong>. I am a webdesigner, or in other words a front-end developer. I'm still in school. I go to school in <strong>Amsterdam</strong>. And live in <strong>Purmerend</strong>. For the people wondering why my portfolio is in English. The reason is that i'm half American and I have to show my work internationaly.  I am very passionate about my work. In this feeld you have to stand-out in one or another way because everybody is a webdesigner now-a-days. Thats why I try to pore a little bit of me in every design I make. Now you are wondering what is that? It's quality I don't just make things, no I consider the user two. Everytime I ask myself if I was the user what would I want? After the first stages of design I try to test it on people that are simular to the end-user. </p>

            <h3>When did it all start?</h3>
            <p>Back in highschool I was always drawing and letting my imagination go free. This finaly resaluted in a creative job and passion. I love the things I do I actualy always have but back then I did'nt know what it was.  <p>

        <li >
            <h3>Why do I do this?</h3>
            <p>One of the first lessons I learned was to always do the things that make you happy and you love. I did'nt know what that was a long time, tried a lot of different things. But since I started my school. I knew this was perfect for me.  </p>
